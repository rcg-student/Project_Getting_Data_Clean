# Project_Getting_Data_Clean

Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The original data for the analysis proceeds from:

The run_analysis.R file contains the code to complain with the following instructions:

    Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
    Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
    Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
    From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
